# Introduction

Modification of [keenerd/packer](https://github.com/keenerd/packer) to allow using *BitBucket* [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)-like repo and `--force` arg 
`pacman`'s option.

# Use

Because I currently use `packer` (although I still keep `yaourt`) I have modified
the original repo to be able to use a specific git repository from *BitBucket*. 
It should be easy to adapt it for *Github* API.

Currently it is only supported the install function:
`packer --bbrepo g4lbb:aur -S package-name`

Another feature added to this modification is the possibility to `force` the installation.
It is something that I missed from the original `packer`.
`packer --force -S package-name` or `packer --bbrepo g4lbb:aur --force -S package-name`

# TODO 

-   github AUR-like support (`--ghrepo` or similar)
-   allow searches
-   allow updates

They are <span class="underline">not planned</span> for the near future because these modifications solves
my problems/requests. If you want to modify again or allow more options, do it or request to me ;)
